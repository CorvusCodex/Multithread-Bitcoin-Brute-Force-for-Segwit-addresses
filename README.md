# Multithread Bitcoin Brute Force for Segwit addresses( also known as Bech32 )
This is a Node.js script that uses multiple worker processes to generate random private keys for Bitcoin Segwit addresses are also known as Bech32 wallets and check if they match any of the Segwit addresses are also known as Bech32 addresses in a file named `data.txt`

## Usage

1. Add the Bitcoin addresses you want to check against to a file named `data.txt`, with one address per line.
2. Run `node app.js` to start the script.
3. Pick verison, default is 1
4. The script will display the loop count for each worker process in real-time.
5. If a match is found, the wallet address and its private key will be saved to a file named `match.txt` and the script will exit.
